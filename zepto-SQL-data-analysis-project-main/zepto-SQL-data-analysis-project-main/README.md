# Zepto E-commerce SQL Data Analysis (PostgreSQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce inventory data using PostgreSQL.
The objective is to extract meaningful business insights related to pricing,
discounts, stock availability, and product performance.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- SQL
- GitHub

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains product-level information such as:
- Product name
- Category
- Price
- Discount
- Stock availability

## 📊 Key Business Questions Answered
- Which product categories have the highest number of items?
- Which products have the highest discounts?
- Which low-stock products are at risk of going out of stock?
- How do discounts impact product availability?

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Data exploration using SQL
- Aggregations (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
- Joins and subqueries
- CTEs (`WITH`)
- Conditional logic (`CASE WHEN`)

## 📈 Insights
- Identified products with high discounts but low stock, indicating high demand
- Certain categories consistently show higher inventory risk

## 🚀 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of PostgreSQL for real-world
e-commerce data analysis and supports beginner-level data analyst roles.
